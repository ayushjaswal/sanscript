Hello, World!

This is just a prototype for now. This is just a personal project. I am writing my own language :)
For now I don't want to get my hopes high about it. I just want to treat it as another personal project. I really have zero idea about how to make a programming language or do low level programming. Yk I am kind of javascript and python guy. But we will learn and make it. 

At this point I have started implementing tokenization, many tokens have been added and more are on the way. I am trying to do this trivial task ASAP let's hope I don't loose interest midway and forget about it. 
So, why "sanscript"? I’m not entirely sure. Maybe it’s because it sounds similar to Sanskrit (an ancient Indian language), or perhaps it’s because I want it to be similar to JavaScript in functionality. I envision it having DOM manipulation capabilities, though I’m still figuring out how to achieve that.

Properties of sanscript:
- It will be a statically and strongly typed (in order to handle what JS misses i.e basic common sense)
- It will be faster than JS (we'll see how)
- It will be Object Oriented (in later future)
- DOM manipulation capabilities (in later future)

So far I have only thought about these things. 

MOTIVATION TO DO THIS:
Well there are valid reasons for me to enter this rabbit hole of hell. Firstly I really like JS, however it lacks basic common sense and if not done properly it acts funny. To handle these issues TS was born and even though it is a great addition to the whole JS ecosystem it still isn't perfect, it eventually compiles down to JS. 
secondary reason is to just get started with this personal project of mine.

Suggestions and helps are welcomed just email me :)
